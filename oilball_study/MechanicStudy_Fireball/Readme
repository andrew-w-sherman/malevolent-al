This mechanic study uses two objects the square which represents the fire character, and a cirlce object which represents the oil.
Clicking the fire character will launch it in a predetermined direction towards the oil. When the oil is hit it will continue
slowing down over time or hit a wall and bounce off in one of 8 predetermined directions depending on the incoming angle and the
angle of the wall. Hitting reset starts the simulation over again
