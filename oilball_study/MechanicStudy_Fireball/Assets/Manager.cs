	//Okay so clicking a firebox will hit the oil box and make it go and either
        //hit a wall and bounce off with slowing momentum
        //hit an enemy and disappear

    //onclick the fire will movetowards the oil and hit the collider
        //check to see what the normal physics engine does
        //build your own shit using trigonometry and figuring out how it will be slowing down on impact yay physics -> research tonight
            //use an 8 direction model for bouncing off the ball, the ball slows down by an arbitrary amount

    //Okay so I did this weird hybrid of Unity engine and my own physics to simplify the engine
